  <p>
    This is the ninth class of CSS and html. In this class the first topic we learned is the grid.Previously we did a developer portfolio that has some grid work on them. But at that time we did not learn grid. So we did that project just using the flex display. Which to be honest was doable but a lot of work. But using grid can make this project much more easier and less time consuming. In this class we will learn about grid.In simpler terms we can say that grid is like table in MS Word. We will define how many row and column we need and their height and width and it will automatically take up the required space. But in this case you have do a lot of calculation. You have to remember the line and space between them. and write down on the code flawlessly. Otherwise you are screwed.

    In order to feel not so intimidated we can take a much simpler part. We can just map them and use letter to fill them up accordingly.
