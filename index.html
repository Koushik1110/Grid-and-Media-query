  <h1 class="grid">Grid</h1>
  <p>
    This is the ninth class of CSS and html. In this class the first topic we learned is the grid.Previously we did a developer portfolio that has some grid work on them. But at that time we did not learn grid. So we did that project just using the flex display. Which to be honest was doable but a lot of work. But using grid can make this project much more easier and less time consuming. In this class we will learn about grid.In simpler terms we can say that grid is like table in MS Word. We will define how many row and column we need and their height and width and it will automatically take up the required space. But in this case you have do a lot of calculation. You have to remember the line and space between them. and write down on the code flawlessly. Otherwise you are screwed.

    In order to feel not so intimidated we can take a much simpler part. We can just map them and use letter to fill them up accordingly.With this method we can change our layout within a matter of seconds.

  <div class="grid_container">
    <div class="box box_one">1</div>
    <div class="box box_two">2</div>
    <div class="box box_three">3</div>
    <div class="box box_four">4</div>
    <div class="box box_five">5</div>
    <div class="box box_six">6</div>
  </div>
  <p> In this above grid we used grid template areas to easily create our desired format. From my personal experience the best tip for easily creating a grid is to use MS word to open a table and fill it up with letters. Then you copy the pattern on the grid template area.</p>

    Media Query
  </h1>
  <p>
    Media query is a option that is used to determine the screen breakpoint of a device.As we all use different sort of device, the size of the display is different for everyone.So the viewing angel of the website may differ from device to device.As a result it may cause some issue for the users. In order to solve the problem we need to use responsiveness for all devices. To make a device responsive we need to know the breakpoint.As we worked on the media query, different device will see the grid box differently. As a matter of fact I am working this project on a laptop. So I am seeing the grid table in <span style="color: orange;">"orange color"</span>. Write down which one of the rainbow color do you see in Facebook group.
